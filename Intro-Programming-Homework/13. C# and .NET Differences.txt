C# and C#.NET are the same thing. C#.NET is a library of code that .NET languages can talk to.
ASP.NET is the portion of the .NET library used for making web sites.
There are other subsections of ASP.NET like WebForms (the old way of making web pages) or the rapidly maturing MVC
library that are worth looking at too.
Forms (old tech) or the new WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
are the technologies you'd typically use in .NET to create what you know as traditional desktop applications.
